Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

# <Henry's Prework Project>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    As a teenager I've always wanted to get involved in the tech world, and I told myself that some day I will become a web or software developer. I was always the go-to person when people needed help fixing their computers, mobile devices, and gaming consoles. I taught myself how to diagnose certain issues wether it was a physical, internal, or firmware issue.

- Why did you build this project? 

    The reason for building this project was to learn and prep myself to take on what I'll be doing for the rest of the course. 

- What problem does it solve?

    The problems that got the most of my attention was saving my work to GitHub. You can make very simple mistakes on the terminal by entering the wrong command. It's also good to keep track of the directory and branch you are in. The "script.js" file got deleted off my computer during the process of saving. I created an error to the "feature/add-js" branch. I was unable to find the cause for it therefore I repeated the steps and created a fixed branch.

    Another problem I had fun with and solving was the JavaScript lesson where you had to debug some problems. I like that I actually saw how and why the problems occurred, it was an example of some mistakes people or myself can make. It's nice to see how the page worked after I got it working. Refresh the page and you'll see the magic happen with DevTool console opened! 

- What did you learn?

    I learned not to repeat my mistakes again. Like I mentioned above, I had issues saving my work and my files disappearing. I learned how to use the commands wisely on Git Bash. As I kept going I noticed repeated patterns, and as I go I got a bit faster. Another thing I learned which I never noticed for HTML, the <"head"> element doesn't display for the user while the <"body"> element does. The <"head"> element contains the meta elements, which the user won't see except the title on the top of the window tab.

This prework study guide can be for future me to review back and see what I've improved. Each section contains notes about certain topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If we open Google DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first!
